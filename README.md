# Customer Churn Prediction Web Application

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application designed to predict customer churn using a machine learning model. The application helps businesses identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing for targeted interventions. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and deployment.

**Project Duration:** February 2024 - May 2024

## Features
- **Backend**: Developed using Python and Flask, featuring RESTful APIs for data handling and model predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented a Random Forest Classifier achieving an accuracy of 87%.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to identify key factors influencing customer churn.
- **Frontend**: Designed a responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render for public access.

## Tech Stack
